Use OpenGL to display the game, and the main point in this section is to decide the format of data that transferred between PIC32 and laptop. We come up with two approaches, the first approach is that PIC32 sends data of every frame to laptop. For example, the figure below shows the message transmitted in one frame, as you can see the 1 represents blocks and 2 represents paddle. The advantage of this approach is that the laptop just parse the message and show each part accordingly, but the drawback is that the data transmitted in one frame is very long, and we are concerned that it may exceeds the maximum bandwidth of UART module. And then we come up with the second approach, in this time PIC32 just sends things that change between each frame. For example, the message now just contains the location of balls, paddle and the condition change of blocks. As you can see, the data length is reduced a lot, but the laptop will do more work to process the data and decide what to display.
